## Reading recommendation
1. For a comprehensive explanation of how user space interacts with the kernel space: The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk
2. For a good introduction to device drivers, but also core kernel knowledge:
Linux Device Driver Development by John Madieu 
3. Linux Kernel Debugging by Kaiwan N Billimoria
4. [The official documentation of the kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/) 

## My notes

- Faux devices vs Platform devices
- Debugging techniques
